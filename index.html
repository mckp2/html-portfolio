<h1>Gang what the hell</h1>
<h1> lock in </h1>
<p1> this coding larks fairly easy gang Iwl. Html is barely real coding IMO.<br/> Since there is a horozontol rule 
does that imply the existance of a  vertical rule? One must imagine sypsphius happy*insert more impressive philospical arguments and statements here<br/>
such as if  you replace each part of a  ship at which point does it become a different ship? <br/>
Probobly when each part of the ship is finnally replaced imo but philosphers will give you this whole ass speach and not answer the question<br/>
If it is not obvious by now I dont like philosphy its kind of usesless would not reccomend studying it. You will end up next to the art and computer science majors<br/>
Like did you know that old philosphers like socrates would just flex on his opponent to win arguments. Diomedes lived in a barrel and the people they debated were barely educated<br/>
Litearlly a useless subject. Like their homework is probobly just to have an idea. Like why bother its literally a dead degree<br/>
the only way you are getting a job with a degree like philosphy is if you are teaching philospy same with egyptolgy and others its litearlly a pyramid scheme<br/>
